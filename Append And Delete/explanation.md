I start by comparing s and t to find the longest matching part at the beginning.
Next, I calculate how many characters need to be deleted from s and how many need to be added to make it into t.
If the total operations are more than k, itâ€™s impossible, so return "No".
If the operations fit exactly, or if I can adjust with extra even steps, or if k is large enough to delete and rebuild everything, return "Yes".
