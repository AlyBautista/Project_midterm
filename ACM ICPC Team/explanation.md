The function checks how many topics a team can know.
It looks at all possible pairs of people.
For each pair, it counts the topics at least one person knows.
If the pair knows more topics than before, update the maximum.
If the pair knows the same maximum, increase the team count.
At the end, it returns the maximum topics and the number of teams that know it.
