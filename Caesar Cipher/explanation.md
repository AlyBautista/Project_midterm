The Caesar Cipher function works by shifting each letter in the string by a given number of positions in the alphabet. 
It first reduces the shift using k % 26 so it always stays within the alphabet range. 
For uppercase and lowercase letters, it converts them to their ASCII values, applies the shift, and then converts them back to letters. 
Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged. Finally, it combines all characters into the encoded string and returns the result.
